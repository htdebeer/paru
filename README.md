## Introduction

Paru is a simple Ruby wrapper around [pandoc](https://www.pandoc.org),
the great multi-format document converter. Paru supports automating
pandoc by writing Ruby programs and using pandoc in your Ruby programs
(see [Chapter 2 in the
manual](https://heerdebeer.org/Software/markdown/paru/#automating-the-use-of-pandoc-with-paru)).
Paru also supports writing pandoc filters in Ruby (see [Chapter 3 in the
manual](https://heerdebeer.org/Software/markdown/paru/#writing-and-using-pandoc-filters-with-paru)).
In [paru’s manual](https://heerdebeer.org/Software/markdown/paru/) the
use of paru is explained in detail, from explaining how to install and
use paru, creating and using filters, to putting it all together in a
real-world use case: generating the manual!

See also the [paru API
documentation](https://heerdebeer.org/Software/markdown/paru/documentation/api-doc/).

**Note** If you’re using pandoc 3, use paru version 1.1.x or higher;
paru 1.0.x doesn’t work with pandoc 3. If you’re still using pandoc
version 2, use paru version 1.0.x instead.

This README is a brief overview of paru’s features and usages.

### Installation

Paru is installed through rubygems as follows:

``` bash
gem install paru
```

You can also build and install the latest version gem yourself by
running the following commands:

``` bash
cd /path/to/paru/repository
bundle install
rake build
gem install pkg/paru-1.4.0.gem
```

Paru, obviously, requires pandoc. See
<https://pandoc.org/installing.html> about how to install pandoc on your
system and [pandoc’s manual](https://pandoc.org/README.html) on how to
use pandoc.

You can generate the [API documentation for
paru](https://heerdebeer.org/Software/markdown/paru/documentation/api-doc/)
by cloning the repository and running `rake yard`. It’ll put it in
`documentation/api-doc`.

## Paru says hello to pandoc

Using paru is straightforward. It is a thin “rubyesque” layer around the
pandoc executable. After requiring paru in your ruby program, you create
a new paru pandoc converter as follows:

``` ruby
require "paru/pandoc"

converter = Paru::Pandoc.new
```

The various [command-line options of
pandoc](https://pandoc.org/README.html#options) map to methods on this
newly created instance. When you want to use a pandoc command-line
option that contains dashes, replace all dashes with an underscore to
get the corresponding paru method. For example, the pandoc command-line
option `--pdf-engine` becomes the paru method `pdf_engine`. Knowing this
convention, you can convert from markdown to pdf using the lualatex
engine by calling the `from`, `to`, and `pdf_engine` methods to
configure the converter. There is a convenience `configure` method that
takes a block to configure multiple options at once:

``` ruby
require "paru/pandoc"

converter = Paru::Pandoc.new
converter.configure do
    from "markdown"
    to "latex"
    pdf_engine "lualatex"
    output "my_first_pdf_file.pdf"
end
```

As creating and immediately configuring a converter is a common pattern,
the constructor takes a configuration block as well. Finally, when you
have configured the converter, you can use it to convert a string with
the `convert` method, which is aliased by The `<<` operator. You can
call `convert` multiple times and re-configure the converter in between.

This introductory section is ended by the obligatory “hello world”
program, paru-style:

``` ruby
#!/usr/bin/env ruby
require "paru/pandoc"

input = "Hello world, from **pandoc**"

output = Paru::Pandoc.new do
    from "markdown"
    to "html"
end << input

puts output
```

Running the above program results in the following output:

``` html
<p>Hello world, from <strong>pandoc</strong></p>
```

To support converting files that cannot easily be represented by a
single string, such as EPUB or docx, paru also has the `convert_file`
method. It takes a path as argument, and when executed, it tells pandoc
to convert that path using the current configured pandoc configuration.

In the next chapter, the development of *do-pandoc.rb* is presented as
an example of real-world usage of paru.

## Writing and using pandoc filters with paru

One of pandoc’s interesting capabilities are [custom
filters](https://pandoc.org/scripting.html). This is an extremely
powerful feature that allows you to automate certain tasks, such as
numbering figures, using other command-line programs to pre or post
process parts of the input, or change the structure of the input
document before having pandoc writing it out. Paru allows you to write
pandoc filters in Ruby.

For a collection of paru filters, have a look at the
[paru-filter-collection](https://github.com/htdebeer/paru-filter-collection).

The simplest paru pandoc filter is the *identity* filter that does do
nothing:

``` ruby
#!/usr/bin/env ruby
# Identity filter
require "paru/filter"

Paru::Filter.run do
    # nothing
end
```

Nevertheless, it shows the structure of every paru pandoc filter: A
filter is an executable script (line 1), it uses the `paru/filter`
module, and it executes a `Paru::Filter` object. Running the identity
filter is a good way to start writing your own filters. In the next
sections several simple but useful filters are developed to showcase the
use of paru to write pandoc filters in Ruby.

A more useful filter is to numbering figures. In some output formats,
such as PDF, HTML + CSS, or ODT, figures can be automatically numbered.
In other formats, notably markdown itself, numbering has to be done
manually. However, it is very easy to create a filter that does this
numbering of figures automatically as well:

``` ruby
#!/usr/bin/env ruby
# Number all figures in a document and prefix the caption with "Figure".
require "paru/filter"

figure_counter = 0;

Paru::Filter.run do 
    with "Image" do |image|
        figure_counter += 1
        image.inner_markdown = "Figure #{figure_counter}. #{image.inner_markdown}"
    end
end
```

The filter `number_figures.rb` keeps track of the last figure’s sequence
number in `counter`. Each time an
[Image](https://heerdebeer.org/Software/markdown/paru/documentation/api-doc/Paru/PandocFilter/Image.html)
is encountered while processing the input file, that counter is
incremented and the image’s caption is prefixed with “Figure
\#{counter}.” by overwriting the image’s node’s inner markdown.

For more information about writing filters, please see [paru’s
manual](https://heerdebeer.org/Software/markdown/paru/) or the API
documentation for the
[Filter](https://heerdebeer.org/Software/markdown/paru/documentation/api-doc/Paru/Filter.html)
class. Furthermore, example filters can also be found in the [filters
sub directory](examples/filters) of paru’s [examples](examples/). Feel
free to copy and adapt them to your needs.

## Documentation

### Manual

For more information on automatic the use of pandoc with paru or writing
pandoc filters in ruby, please see paru’s
[manual](https://heerdebeer.org/Software/markdown/paru/).

### API documentation

The [API
documentation](https://heerdebeer.org/Software/markdown/paru/documentation/api-doc/)
covers the whole of paru. Where the manual just describes a couple of
scenarios, the API documentation shows all available functionality. It
also give more examples of using paru and writing filters.

### Frequently asked questions

Feel free to ask me a question: [send me an
email](mailto:Huub@heerdebeer.org) or submit a new
[issue](https://github.com/htdebeer/paru/issues) if you’ve found a bug!

- *I get an error like “Erro: JSON parse error: Error in \$:
  Incompatible API versions: encoded with \[1,20\] but attempted to
  decode with \[1,21\].”*

  The versions of pandoc and paru you are using are incompatible. Please
  install the latest versions of pandoc and paru.

  Why does this happen? Internally pandoc uses
  [pandoc-types](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/pandoc-types) to
  represent documents its converts and filters. Documents represented by
  one version of pandoc-types are slightly incompatible with documents
  represented by another version of pandoc-types. This also means that
  filters written in paru for one version of pandoc-types are not
  guaranteed to work on documents represented by another version of
  pandoc-types. As a result, not all paru versions work together with
  all pandoc versions.

  As a general rule: Use the latest versions of pandoc and paru.

- *I get an error like “‘values_at’: no implicit conversion of String
  into Integer (TypeError) from lib/paru/filter/document.rb:54:in
  ‘from_JSON’”*

  The most likely cause is that you’re using an old version of Pandoc.
  Paru version 0.2.x only supports pandoc version 1.18 and up. In pandoc
  version 1.18 there was a breaking API change in the way filters
  worked. Please upgrade your pandoc installation.
